                    <b>Briefly About the Game </b>  ALES, which I developed for the Turkey High School Game Development Competition "Eğitijam 2024", was invited to the finals among 146 teams of 542 students and called to ODTÜ Teknopark in Ankara. My first "fun" game that I can call a game. My classmate Receb, who took Ales out of a simple 3-day jam project (it was formed by my classmate Receb (who finished the game with 5 minutes of gameplay dozens of times from start to finish and played for 5 hours and said that I should add levels to the game), I said that if I can add new levels, why don't I make the game for mobile and I ported it to mobile by adding new levels within 3 weeks after returning from Ankara.

                    <span>What I Did?</span>
                </h4>

                <ul style="line-height:2;">
                    <li>What do you mean "3 people appear but I did everything"? Yes, exactly as you read. Since it was an inter-high school competition, a team of minimum 2 people was required, so I called 2 friends from my class (One of them came on the first day of the Jam, wrote the walking code (I did not use the code he wrote) and left. The other one came to visit Ankara city for free after the jam was over (travel and hotel expenses were provided by the organising organisation). </li>
                    <li> I wrote my own code first (I don't know if any other game has done the maze mechanics in the game before (I WILL NOT RESEARCH) so I feel like I have found a game mechanic from 0 and this feeling is really nice </li>
                    <li> I added a lot to myself in terms of level design.</li>
                    <li> I have learnt first hand that developing games for mobile platform is different from the computer, even if I have suffered first hand.</li>
                    <li> For the first time I added an advert to a game.</li>
